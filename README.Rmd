# TravelExample
This is an example package to show how to build package based upon the Travel package. Please see code under `src/` to find the detailed information. You can run these test code to see the result

```{r}
devtools::load_all()

## Create a super lengthy arithmetic sequence
x <- make_sequence_altrep(n = 1024*1024*1024*64, start = 1, step = 2)
length(x)
x[1:10]

## You can change the value of the vector without any problem
x[1] <- 100
x[1:10]

## The private data of the vector will be GC
## When the vector is not in used(see `Seq_info` in `main.cpp`)
rm(x)
gc()
```
